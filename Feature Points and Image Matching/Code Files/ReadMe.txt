There are 2 files in the zip folder 

1) R00182615_MV_A01_Report.pdf- This is the documentation of the task 1 and task 2 carried out for this assignment. It contains the respective outputs and images generated for each of the sub-tasks ----> task 1 and task 2. 

2) R00182615_MV_A01.py - Python file having all the code of the sub-parts of task 1 and task 2 each being well commented. The file also contains the reference of the task and sub-part for which the particular piece of code is refering to. 

Here we have Task 1 and Task 2. Task 1 have sub-parts - (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G) and Task 2 have sub-parts (A), (B) and (C).  

Inside the main function of the python file, if you initialize the task variable = 1 then all the sub-parts of the task 1 will be executed and if you initialize the task variable to the value = 2, then all the sub-parts of the task 2 will be executed which is clearly well indicated by the detailed comments.  

Each execution of the sub-parts will generate the respective images which are displayed in a seperate window. You need to close all the images so that the program flow is shifted to the execution of the next sub-part of the same task. Main idea is to close the windows of the images generated to see the output images of the next sub-part of the selected task through the task variable.
